# Kicad Notes
Kicad is a free to use pcb design software.

### Steps to design a PCB
* Schematics
* Footprints
* Placement of Components
* Designing profile and Routing
---
**Schematics** is layout of different components that are used in the PCB. 
> Some imp terms are:
* _Add components_
* _Anotate_
* _Electrical Rule Checker_
* _Bill of Components.csv_
* _Tags and net labels_
---
**Footprints** defines how the components looks on the pcb. We have to assign a footprint to each components. There are different types of footprints available for a single Components. It depends on factors like size, current, SMD or THT, etc.
> Run Footprint assignment Tool  
---
**PCB Design** designs the pcb. Commponents are placed and then routing of copper is done in different layer. It also allows to view PCB in 3D.
> Some imp terms are:
* Tools --> Update PCB from Schematics
* edge cut layer
* cut tracks and ground tracks
* _via_ (hole)
* _Red_ front layer
* _Blue_ back layer
* _Run PCB design rule checker_ for errors
* _Alt + 3_ --> 3d viewer

### Extra

SnapEDA is used for finding footprints and Schematics.
